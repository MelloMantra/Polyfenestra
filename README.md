# Polyfenestra v3
A batch project that has zero practical use.

### Use
Download the Polyfenestra.bat file only. Allow your enemies to run the file and be doomed to a forced restart or BSOD.

I call it Polyfenestra because "fenestra" means window in Latin. You may have an idea what this file does now. At the cost of some extra time to load, it provides triple the lag inducing power as v1. Included in the package is a .mp3 file containing Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give You Up" that plays when the program is run. Have fun killing your friends' CPUs. (Temporarily of course)
